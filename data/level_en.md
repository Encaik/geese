## What is the Community Level

The HelloGitHub community level is a value system for counting the contributions made by open source enthusiasts to the HelloGitHub community, reflecting the contribution and prestige of open source enthusiasts in this community.

We encourage everyone to share interesting and entry-level open source projects, valuable and attitude-having project reviews, and fair scoring. These actions will earn **contribution points**, and malicious submissions and spam comments will also deduct contribution points.

## Level Benefits

HelloGitHub community levels are calculated and upgraded in real-time based on contribution points.

## Earn and Deduct Contribution Points

Community building depends on everyone; these rules are not shackles that restrict freedom, but the foundation of equality for all.

### 1. Rules for Adding Contribution Points

- **Self-recommendation/Sharing Open Source Projects**: Click on the "Submit Project" on the homepage to share open source projects on GitHub, and you will earn **5 contribution points**.
- **Publish Project Reviews**: Click on "Comment" on the project details page and publish your evaluation of the project. After publishing the comment, you can get **2 contribution points**. If the comment is selected by the administrator as a **hot review**, you can get an additional **10 contribution points**. (Comments cannot be deleted or modified after posting)
- **Participate in Community Building**: Contribute to the community by [contributing code](https://github.com/HelloGitHub-Team/geese), UI design, [feedback BUG](https://hellogithub.yuque.com/forms/share/d268c0c0-283f-482a-9ac8-939aa8027dfb), etc., and you will earn **1-50 contribution points** based on your contributions to the community.

### 2. Rules for Deducting Contribution Points

- **Submitting useless/malicious content**: Posting projects and comments that include but are not limited to spamming, personal attacks, politics, pornography, discrimination, etc., will deduct **2-10 contribution points**. Those with serious circumstances will be banned.

**We hope that this place will become a pure land for open source enthusiasts, where everyone can share and discuss open source projects enthusiastically.**
