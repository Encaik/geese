## I. Introduction

Are you already overwhelmed by the monotonous CRUD business code, and tired of the endless process of installing dependencies and deploying environments just to create a webpage, followed by the never-ending updates of dependency versions?

The OneFile programming challenge with a single file is here to awaken your interest and pleasure in coding!

Write the code you want, with the simplest code in **just one file**, and find back the original joy of programming.

## II. Requirements

When you step away from modern frameworks and libraries, the opportunity to showcase your talent comes! If you have an idea, you should write it down quickly. It may not need to be very complex; perhaps one file is enough.

The **one-file** programming challenge has the following requirements:

- A single file, not compressed, with a size smaller than 1 MB
- Clear code structure, including comments, and fewer than 5000 lines of code
- Any programming language is allowed, but cannot only contain Markdown files
- No external files are introduced (images, videos, CSS, etc.)
- The project function is complete and has learning or usage value
- (Optional) Up to one open-source library or framework may be depended on

The collected works will be promoted through HelloGitHub's accounts across the entire network (more than 200,000 fans), allowing your project to help more people and be loved by more people.

In addition to submitting your own works, you can also share projects collected from the internet, but the author and source of the code must be indicated.

## IV. Final Thoughts

Every project starts with a single file and becomes what you see today through continuous iteration. The one file you submit today is a seed.
